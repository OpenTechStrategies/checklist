Several of our clients at [Open Tech Strategies, LLC](http://OpenTechStrategies.com/) have requested a checklist for doing open source software development, with special attention paid to guiding contractors who may be new to open source processes.  We are publishing this [Open Source Development Checklist](oss-dev-checklist.md) both in the hope that it will be useful to others as well as to those clients, and to have the benefit of others' [feedback](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/checklist/issues).

Please note that the intended audience of the checklist is _not_ the typical open source developer, who already knows much of this material.  It is organizations who either do not have much experience with open source development, or who sometimes do not have much experience with software development at all and who contract out most or all of their development work.
